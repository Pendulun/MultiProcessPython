# MultiProcessPython

This is where I keep my studies about multithreading, multiprocessing and parallel programming with Python.

All I've studied was following [this Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/programacao-concorrente-e-assincrona-com-python/) from [GeekUniversity](https://www.geekuniversity.com.br/). I'm currently reading more about Cython on [their docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
